Summary: ' Identify individual API opportunities that align with organizational strategy and business priorities. Collaborate with stakeholders to document API roadmaps and ensure alignment with business goals.'
Step 1: >-
  <ol id=""><li>Business goals are defined.</li><li>Market research identifies
  API opportunities.</li><li>Stakeholders approve strategy
  discussions.</li></ol>
Step 2: >-
  <ul><li>Provide guidelines and templates for creating API business models,
  value propositions, and roadmaps.</li></ul>
Step 3: >-
  <ol id=""><li>Individual API opportunities are identified and
  documented.</li><li>The API meets a clear business need and is reusable for
  multiple API-consumers.</li><li>API is designed for hiding backend data models
  and discrepancies.</li><li>Value proposition is validated with key
  stakeholders.</li><li>API consumer segments (internal and external) are
  identified.</li><li>High-level roadmaps for API development are
  established.</li></ol><h4 id="">‍</h4>

  <p id="">Developer portal or documentation site UI design. Usability and
  graphics are both important.</p><p id="">Use company branding and content
  creation guidelines. But remember, your audience is much more technical than
  the average customer.</p><p id="">‍</p><h5 id="">Can all your API consumers
  access all APIs?</h5><p id="">Depending on developer portal capabilities and
  API -specific configuration developers can subscribe access to APIs
  with</p><ul id=""><li id="">self-service or</li><li id="">self-service with
  approval workflow</li></ul><p id="">‍</p><h6 id="">Content and communication
  guidelines</h6><p id="">All human readable API documentation pages should be
  created automatically from API productization and OpenAPI documents. Masters
  should be stored and edited using version control, not just in the developer
  portal / documentation site.</p><p id="">Content, language, what information
  is shared, which channels and formats are used, etc. should be planned and
  optimized for your developer community.</p><p id="">Terms and conditions for
  using our APIs are important. Remember to create them together with business,
  legal and technology people. They need to address privacy and re-use, service
  levels and data ownership. Try to still keep them understandable.</p><p
  id="">You can create SDKs or provide code snippets. Remember that not all
  developers undestand cURL and that maintaining SDK will require work. Your
  Developer Portal may provide you a way to generate code snippets automatically
  from an Open API definition.</p><p id="">Presentations and demos help
  developers understand what they can use the API for. They may also need help
  in using the tools or figuring out the authentication. so make sure you
  address that, too.</p><p id="">Think how you are going to collect feedback and
  feature suggestions.</p><p id="">Some additional things that can impact
  developer experience:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Marketing communication (ads,
  swag, press releases…)</li><li id="">Monetization (API pricing and payments
  handling) can be used, if your API business model requires it and your own or
  your API management platform supports it natively or by connecting to payment
  gateways.</li><li id="">Customer stories (testimonials, interviews
  etc.)</li><li id="">Release notes/change logs</li><li id="">Plugins and
  ready-made integrations</li></ul><p id="">‍</p><p id="">‍</p><p id="">‍</p><p
  id="">‍</p><h5 id="">Choose your identities carefully</h5><p id="">Pay a few
  moments of attention to how your API Consuming applications and developers
  need to authenticate to your APIs and your developer portal. Your priority
  maybe to make it very easy, but remember to make it secure enough.</p><p
