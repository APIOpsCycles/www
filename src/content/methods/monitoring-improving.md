Summary: >-
  Define and monitor performance metrics (e.g., API calls, latency, error rates)
  and adoption metrics (e.g., NPS). Analyze API usage metrics and incorporate
  user feedback into API iterations.
Step 1: >-
  <ol id=""><li>APIs are published with discoverable
  documentation.</li><li>Registration processes are operational.</li><li>Support
  and communication channels for API consumers are ready.</li><li>Legal and
  compliance requirements for providing and consuming the API are clear enough
  for publishing.</li></ol>
Step 2: >-
  <ul><li>Set up analytics frameworks to track performance and engagement.
  </li><li>Develop feedback loops, analytics tools, and engagement strategies
  for APIs.</li></ul>
Step 3: <ol><li>Insights from metrics and feedback are used to optimize APIs</li></ol>

Section 1 summary: >-
  <p>There are the typical dashboards and measures used for measuring business
  and technical performance and developer satisfaction for APIs. Depending on
  the API management platform used, there are analytics dashboards available in
  the Developer portal for API consumers and in the API management portal for
  API Providers. In most API management platforms, there is a way to export in
  real-time or manually the data to BI- or log analytics tools or any platform
  using APIs.</p><h3>‍</h3>
