Purpose: >-
  One of the fundamental challenges in IoT projects is that various IT
  specialists, device experts, platform providers, and business experts often
  fail to understand one another – or, more precisely, the implications of each
  other's domains on their own. In the realm of IoT, business expertise
  encapsulates all areas where IoT is utilised.

Tips for use: >-
  <p id="">For instance, experts might oversee aspects ranging from traffic
  light control to transportation and environmental issues. Consequently,
  project planning meetings can easily devolve into a series of monologues by
  these experts, with interactions reminiscent of ships passing in the
  night.</p><p id="">‍</p><p>‍</p>
Steps: >-
  <p id="">Columns on the canvas represent organisational objectives, usability
  requirements (including environmental conditions, especially for devices),
  data requirements, and technology and security requirements. Rows cater to
  applications, storage locations, communication with devices (i.e., the core of
  the IoT platform), and the devices with their embedded software.</p><p
  id="">The underlying principle is that moving from left to right and top to
  bottom, the various columns and layers influence each other and pose
  requirements to one another. Read in the opposite direction; they offer
  opportunities to each other.</p><p id="">To maximise the benefit of the
  canvas, use it before letting specialists from different fields speak up. The
  canvas can also be leveraged in ecosystem projects, where different
  organisations are responsible for different canvas sections.</p><p id="">Image

  process.</p><p id="">Image 2: Completed canvas (anonymised version from an
  actual workshop)</p><p id="">Instructions for Using the Canvas:</p><ol
  id=""><li id="">Invite the project/procurement planning team and any necessary
  external experts to a workshop. Participants should possess business
  knowledge, an understanding of the organisation/project goals, environment,
  and users, as well as technical expertise from various IoT and IT areas.
  Allocate around 1 to 1.5 hours.</li><li id="">Collaboratively fill in the
  canvas shown in Image 3 using sticky notes on flip chart paper or via a
  digital collaboration platform. The completion is quick, but participants must
  be provided with brief background information and some debriefing
  time.</li><li id="">Ask each participant to start with the most familiar topic
  or one they have any thoughts or questions about. (See examples provided after
  the instructions for inspiration).</li><li id="">Review the canvas
  collectively, engaging in discussions and seeking clarifications where needed.
  Start from the left, move right, and from the top down, commencing with
  organisational goals and concluding with technology and security requirements.
  Re-arrange sticky notes and add details as necessary.</li><li id="">Conclude
  by discussing the most pressing open questions and identified challenges.
  Decide on assigning responsibility before taking further actions (e.g.,
  detailing objectives, mapping architecture, refining requirements, drafting
  guidelines, or agreeing on roles). Summarise the discussion in a few final
  remarks.</li></ol><p id="">Examples of Requirements and Questions:</p><p
